                    | The Riders bikers club, is a motorcycle subculture that has its roots in the
                    | immediate post-World War II era of North American society.[citation needed]
                    | It is generally centered on the use of cruiser motorcycles, particularly
                    | Harley-Davidsons and choppers, and a set of ideals that celebrate freedom,
                    | nonconformity to mainstream culture, and loyalty to the biker group.
